Introduction

This auxiliary material contains a text file, two tables, MATLAB code and 
output from a sample MC calculation, and a directory listing of the 
MATLAB code.

1. 2012gl051440-txts01.doc
Text S1. A complete list of the factors controlling the past and 
future budgets and abundances of CH4, N2O, and HFC-134a that were used 
in this analysis.

2. 2012gl051440-ts01.doc, 2012gl051440-ts01.xls
Table S1. Primary factors controlling the atmospheric abundance of 
N2O, CH4, CH2FCF3.

3. 2012gl051440-ts02.doc, 2012gl051440-ts02.xls
Table S1. Derived factors controlling the atmospheric abundance of 
N2O, CH4, CH2FCF3.

4. 2012gl051440-txts02.txt
Text S2. A directory listing for the MATLAB code that does the Monte 
Carlo (MC) calculation.
/main directory with MATLAB scsripts (*.m) mc_script.m is the primary one 
to execute in MATLAB.
/input   subdirectory with necessary ascii input files
/output  subdirectory with MATLAB binary output created during run 
(*.mat)
/figs    subdirectory with assorted figures created druing the run.

5. 2012gl051440-sfts01.zip
Software S1. The MATLAB code and output from a sample MC calculation.
